## Vic 2 Mods

- Belle Dark Plugin (https://www.moddb.com/mods/belle-cartographie)
- Belle Cartographie HPM (See above)
- HPM (https://www.moddb.com/mods/historical-project-mod)
- VijoMegaCampaignPack (https://github.com/VijoPlays/ParadoxSaveFiles/blob/main/003_vic2/mods/VijoMegaCampaign.zip)
- Vanilla Enhancement Suite Light (https://www.moddb.com/mods/victoria-2-enhancement-suit)
- Improved Names HPM (https://mega.nz/file/qEgHVKpA#GZFR5oqklujeOjy-XFCrRdJ3wGsBLX46olugvnjeanM)
- Would also like to use Square flags, but it conflicts with VES, couldn't get it to work due to my lacking modding skills.

QoL tip: If you play on Steam, go to Vic2 in your game library, Right Click it and find your local Vicky2 Install, copy the path. Right click Vicky2 in Steam again -> Properties -> Adjust launch options and then add the following command:

> "YourPathToVicky2Here/v2game.exe" %command -mod=someModYouWantToAdd

For me this looks like:
> "G:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Victoria 2\v2game.exe" %command% -mod=mod/VijoMegaCampaignPack.mod -mod=mod/BelleDarkPlugin.mod -mod=mod/BelleCartographieHPM.mod -mod=mod/vijoplays_megaCampaign_vic2_2023.mod -mod=HPM.mod -mod=mod/INHPM.mod

(I also removed spaces from .mod files - Steam cuts the command off if its too long, it still works, but makes copying it out of the list clunkier. Because of this, I also moved all files from VES Light into INHPM.)

This immediately boots into Vic2, circumventing selecting every mod in the startup launcher - very nice for trying things out... and also just a QoL thing so you're not too scared to boot up Vicky2.
